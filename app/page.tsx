            In 2023, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Electrical
            Engineering and Computer Sciences, having taken numerous CS courses
            and completed various projects along the way. While I am in the
            early stages of my career, my strong appreciation for purposeful
            design and keen eye for detail have consistently driven my work.

            Currently, I focus on creating innovative software solutions with a
            user-centric approach. I am particularly passionate about developing
            applications that simplify complex tasks and provide an enjoyable
            user experience, leveraging my creativity and love for design.

            Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new hobbies and activities. When
            Iâ€™m not in front of my computer, you can find me playing tennis,
            cooking with friends, or browsing through aesthetic room decor. I
            have a deep appreciation for food, animals, and anything that is
            aesthetically pleasing or cute.
